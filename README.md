# Gold Price Prediction with Machine Learning

## Project Overview
The **"Gold Price Prediction"** project leverages machine learning algorithms to forecast gold prices based on historical data and economic indicators. This solution, designed for investors, traders, and financial analysts, employs a **Random Forest Regressor** model to provide accurate gold price predictions. The project showcases the integration of data collection, preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning model development using Python's popular libraries like **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Scikit-learn**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.

## Key Features
- **Data Collection and Processing**: The project begins with loading and processing a dataset of historical gold prices along with relevant economic indicators. The data is cleaned and prepared for analysis using **Pandas**, ensuring it is suitable for modeling.
  
- **Data Visualization**: Utilizing **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**, the project includes visualizations such as time series plots, histograms, correlation heatmaps, and distribution charts. These visuals allow for easy exploration of trends and relationships within the data.
  
- **Train-Test Split**: The dataset is split into training and testing subsets using **train_test_split** from **Scikit-learn**. This ensures that the model is trained on historical data and validated using unseen data, providing a robust evaluation of its predictive performance.
  
- **Random Forest Regressor**: The heart of the model is the **Random Forest Regressor**, an ensemble method that aggregates predictions from multiple decision trees. This method is particularly effective for capturing non-linear relationships and handling large feature sets, as demonstrated in this project.
  
- **Model Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as **R-squared error**, **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, and **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**. Visual comparisons between predicted and actual gold prices help gauge the modelâ€™s accuracy.
